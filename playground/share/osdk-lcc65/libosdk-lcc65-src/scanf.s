; it seems difficult to avoid adding a buffer to the unbuffered Oric input,
; this consumes a lot of space, but how to do it differently ?

scanbuf .dsb 256

_scanf 
        lda #<scanbuf
        sta tmp
        lda #>scanbuf
        sta tmp+1
        jsr gets
    lda #<scanbuf
    sta loadchar+1
    lda #>scanbuf
    sta loadchar+2
        ldy #0
        jmp scanf
